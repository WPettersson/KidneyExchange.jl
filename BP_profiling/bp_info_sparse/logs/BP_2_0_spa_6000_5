 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 7400

Two new nodes are created by branching on the total number of arcs to get an even number
LB = 3112.0, UB = 3113.0
Processing node 3

- minimum number of arcs in solution 3114

Iteration 1:
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 3112.0, UB = 3113.0
Processing node 2

- maximum number of arcs in solution 3112

Iteration 1:
- current master value: 3112.0
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 3112.0, tree lower bound is 3112.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
