- number of columns in master IP: 29292


New incumbent found with value 6814.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
Two new nodes are created by branching on variable column_flow[9286, 393]
LB = 6814.0, UB = 6829.0
Processing node 3

- the arcs set to one are:Pair{Int64,Int64}[9286 => 393]

Iteration 1:
- current master value: 6829.000000000023
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 6829.0, tree lower bound is 6814.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 3
- number of columns in master IP: 29292


New incumbent found with value 6829.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 6829.0, UB = 6829.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 6829.0 with gap 0.0 %
