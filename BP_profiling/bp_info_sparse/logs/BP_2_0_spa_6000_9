----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 3002.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 1501 cycles
In total, 3002 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
In total, 0 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 3002.0
