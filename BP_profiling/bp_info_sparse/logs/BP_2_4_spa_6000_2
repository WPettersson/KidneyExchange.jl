Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4086.0, tree lower bound is 4084.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 19
- number of columns in master IP: 61990


New incumbent found with value 4085.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
Two new nodes are created by branching on variable column_flow[6434, 5342]
LB = 4085.0, UB = 4086.0
Processing node 21

- the arcs set to one are:Pair{Int64,Int64}[3862 => 668, 5430 => 44, 5174 => 5610, 3008 => 4948, 6213 => 4273, 166 => 1177, 6187 => 5128, 687 => 1905, 789 => 111, 6434 => 5342]

Iteration 1:
- current master value: 4086.000000000002
- nb of cycles added = 0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4086.0, tree lower bound is 4085.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 21
- number of columns in master IP: 61990


New incumbent found with value 4086.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4086.0, UB = 4086.0
