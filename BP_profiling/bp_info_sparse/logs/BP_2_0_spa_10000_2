Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 5446.0, tree lower bound is 5446.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 5446.0, UB = 5446.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 5446.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------
