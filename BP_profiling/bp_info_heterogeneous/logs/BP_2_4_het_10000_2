Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 7633.0, tree lower bound is 6599.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 45245


New incumbent found with value 7633.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 7633.0, UB = 7633.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 7633.0, UB = 7633.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 7633.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 2214 cycles
In total, 4428 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 15 chains
- l = 2: 125 chains
- l = 3: 500 chains
- l = 4: 360 chains
In total, 3205 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 7633.0
