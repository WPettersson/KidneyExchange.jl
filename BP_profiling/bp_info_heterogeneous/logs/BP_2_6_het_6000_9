Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4670.0, tree lower bound is 3001.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 28907


New incumbent found with value 4670.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 4670.0, UB = 4670.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4670.0, UB = 4670.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4670.0 with gap 0.0 %
