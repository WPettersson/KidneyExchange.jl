- current master value: 4656.999999999995
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0
- no positive column was added, switch to optimality search

Iteration 48:
- current master value: 4656.999999999995
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4657.0, tree lower bound is 2768.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 28989


New incumbent found with value 4657.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 4657.0, UB = 4657.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4657.0, UB = 4657.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4657.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 1241 cycles
In total, 2482 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 1 chains
- l = 2: 2 chains
- l = 3: 218 chains
- l = 4: 379 chains
In total, 2175 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 4657.0
