Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 7763.0, tree lower bound is 4592.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 43937


New incumbent found with value 7763.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 7763.0, UB = 7763.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 7763.0, UB = 7763.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 7763.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 2079 cycles
In total, 4158 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 2: 72 chains
- l = 3: 448 chains
- l = 4: 321 chains
- l = 5: 121 chains
- l = 6: 38 chains
In total, 3605 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 7763.0
