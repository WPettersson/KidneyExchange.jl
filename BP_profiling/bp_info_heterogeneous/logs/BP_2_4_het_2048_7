Iteration 54:
- current master value: 1594.999999999999
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 1595.0, tree lower bound is 1027.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 9512


New incumbent found with value 1595.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 1595.0, UB = 1595.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 1595.0, UB = 1595.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 1595.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 421 cycles
In total, 842 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 1 chains
- l = 2: 1 chains
- l = 3: 62 chains
- l = 4: 141 chains
In total, 753 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 1595.0
