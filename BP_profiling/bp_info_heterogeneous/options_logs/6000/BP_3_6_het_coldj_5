 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 264


New incumbent found with value 88.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0

Iteration 74:
- current master value: 4616.0
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0
- no positive column was added, switch to optimality search

Iteration 75:

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4616.0, tree lower bound is 1458.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 121496


New incumbent found with value 4616.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 4616.0, UB = 4616.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4616.0, UB = 4616.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4616.0 with gap 0.0 %
