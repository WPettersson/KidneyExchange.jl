Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 88.0, tree lower bound is 84.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 318


New incumbent found with value 88.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 88.0 with gap 0.0 %

- current master value: 4616.0
- nb of cycles added = 0
nb of chains added = 0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4616.0, tree lower bound is 1881.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 131490


New incumbent found with value 4616.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 4616.0, UB = 4616.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4616.0, UB = 4616.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4616.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 1036 cycles
- k = 3: 536 cycles
In total, 3680 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 146 chains
- l = 2: 34 chains
- l = 3: 95 chains
- l = 4: 56 chains
- l = 5: 21 chains
- l = 6: 18 chains
In total, 936 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 4616.0
