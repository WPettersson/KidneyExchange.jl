Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 6292.0, tree lower bound is 6291.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 30048


New incumbent found with value 6292.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 6292.0, UB = 6292.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 6292.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
