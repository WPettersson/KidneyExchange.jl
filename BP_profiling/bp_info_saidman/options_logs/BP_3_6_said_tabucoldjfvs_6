New incumbent found with value 4120.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 4120.0, UB = 4120.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4120.0, UB = 4120.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4120.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 1282 cycles
- k = 3: 387 cycles
In total, 3725 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 393 chains
- l = 2: 1 chains
In total, 395 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 4120.0
