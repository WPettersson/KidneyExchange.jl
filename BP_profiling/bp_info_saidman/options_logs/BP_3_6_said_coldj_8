 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 264


New incumbent found with value 88.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4147.0, tree lower bound is 639.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 142828


New incumbent found with value 4147.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 4147.0, UB = 4147.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4147.0, UB = 4147.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4147.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------
