Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 88.0, tree lower bound is 84.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 318


New incumbent found with value 88.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 4070.0, tree lower bound is 1008.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 144727


New incumbent found with value 4070.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 4070.0, UB = 4070.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 4070.0, UB = 4070.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 4070.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 1506 cycles
- k = 3: 186 cycles
In total, 3570 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 473 chains
- l = 2: 12 chains
- l = 3: 1 chains
In total, 500 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 4070.0
