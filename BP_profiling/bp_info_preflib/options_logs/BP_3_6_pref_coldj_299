Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 88.0, tree lower bound is 86.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 264


New incumbent found with value 88.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 88.0, UB = 88.0

Node relaxation is solved to optimality
- node upper bound is 1487.0, tree lower bound is 260.0

 Search for a feasible solution at node 1
- number of columns in master IP: 38370


New incumbent found with value 1487.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 1487.0, UB = 1487.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 1487.0, UB = 1487.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 1487.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 470 cycles
- k = 3: 99 cycles
In total, 1237 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 158 chains
- l = 2: 46 chains
In total, 250 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 1487.0
