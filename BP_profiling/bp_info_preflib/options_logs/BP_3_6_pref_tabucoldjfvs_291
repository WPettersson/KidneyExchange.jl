New incumbent found with value 1559.0 found by solving the IP with every column of the pool
After processing root node: LB = 1559.0, UB = 1559.0
The node is either infeasible or pruned by bound
LB = 1559.0, UB = 1559.0

----------------------------------------------------------
 The execution of the branch-and-price is complete
- the solution is optimal
- best solution found: value 1559.0 with gap 0.0 %
----------------------------------------------------------

Numbers of cycles per cycle length
- k = 2: 390 cycles
- k = 3: 178 cycles
In total, 1314 pairs are covered by cycles

Numbers of chains per chain length
- l = 1: 163 chains
- l = 2: 41 chains
In total, 245 pairs are covered by chains

The computed cost of the solution is 1559.0
