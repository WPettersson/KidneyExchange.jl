  abstract={Background: To expand the opportunity for paired live donor kidney transplantation, computerized matching algorithms have been designed to identify maximal sets of compatible donor/recipient pairs from a registry of incompatible pairs submitted as candidates for transplantation. Methods: Demographic data of patients who had been evaluated for live donor kidney transplantation but found to be incompatible with their potential donor (because of ABO blood group or positive crossmatch) were submitted for computer analysis and matching. Data included ABO and HLA types of donor and recipient, \%PRA and specificity of recipient alloantibody, donor/recipient relationship, and the reason the donor was incompatible. The data set used for the initial simulation included 29 patients with one donor each and 16 patients with multiple donors for a total of 45 patients and 68 donor/patient pairs. In addition, a simulation based on OPTN/SRTR data was used to further assess the practical importance of multiple exchange combinations. Results: If only exchanges involving two patient-donor pairs were allowed, a maximum of 8 patient-donor pairs in the data set could exchange kidneys. If 3-way exchanges were also allowed, a maximum of 11 pairs could exchange kidneys. Simulations with OPTN/SRTR data demonstrate that the increase in the number of potential transplants if 3-way exchanges are allowed is robust, and does not depend on the particular patients in our sample. Conclusions: A computerized matching protocol can be used to identify donor/recipient pairs from a registry of incompatible pairs who can potentially enter into donor exchanges that otherwise would not readily occur.},

abstract = {Given a directed graph G=(V,A) with arbitrary arc costs, the Elementary Shortest Path Problem (ESPP) consists of finding a minimum-cost path between two nodes s and t such that each node of G is visited at most once. If negative costs are allowed, the problem is NP-hard. In this paper, several integer programming formulations for the ESPP are compared. We present analytical results based on a polyhedral study of the formulations, and computational experiments where we compare their linear programming relaxation bounds and their behavior within a branch-and-cut framework. The computational results show that a formulation with dynamically generated cutset inequalities is the most effective.}

Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our new models are competitive with all existing solvers---in many cases outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.Finally, we note that our position-indexed chain-edge formulation can be modified in a straightforward way to take post-match edge failure into account, under the restriction that edges have equal probabilities of failure. Post-match edge failure is a primary source of inefficiency in presently-fielded kidney exchanges. We show how to implement such failure-aware matching in our model, and also extend the state-of-the-art general branch-and-price-based non-compact formulation for the failure-aware problem to run its pricing problem in polynomial time.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation}, pages = {25–42}, numpages = {18}, keywords = {stochastic matching, integer programming, kidney exchange, matching markets, branch and price}, location = {Maastricht, The Netherlands}, series = {EC '16} }

abstract = {In recent years several countries have set up policies that allow exchange of kidneys between two or more incompatible patient–donor pairs. These policies lead to what is commonly known as kidney exchange programs. The underlying optimization problems can be formulated as integer programming models. Previously proposed models for kidney exchange programs have exponential numbers of constraints or variables, which makes them fairly difficult to solve when the problem size is large. In this work we propose two compact formulations for the problem, explain how these formulations can be adapted to address some problem variants, and provide results on the dominance of some models over others. Finally we present a systematic comparison between our models and two previously proposed ones via thorough computational analysis. Results show that compact formulations have advantages over non-compact ones when the problem size is large.}

Two main factors determine compatibility of a donor with a patient: blood-type compatibility and tissue-type compatibility. Two or more incompatible pairs can form a cyclic exchange so that each patient can receive a kidney from a compatible donor. In addition, an exchange can be initiated by a non-directed donor (an altruistic donor who does not designate a particular intended patient), and in this case, a chain of exchanges need not form a closed cycle.Current exchange pools are of moderate size and have a dynamic flavor as pairs enroll over time. Further, they contain many highly sensitized patients, i.e., patients that are very unlikely to be tissue-type compatible with a blood-type compatible donor. One major decision clearinghouses are facing is how often to search for allocations (a set of disjoint exchanges). On one hand, waiting for more pairs to arrive before finding allocations will increase the number of matched pairs, especially with highly sensitized patients, and on the other hand, waiting is costly. This paper studies this intrinsic tradeoff between the waiting time, and the number of pairs matched under a myopic, "current-like", matching algorithm called Chunk Matching (CM) that accumulates a given number of incompatible pairs, or a chunk, before searching for an allocation in the pool that consists of easy and hard to match patients.We perform sensitivity analysis on the chunk size given different types of allocations; first, we first study the performance of CM when it searches for allocations limited to cycles of length 2 and show that if the waiting period between two subsequent match runs is a sub-linear function of the problem size (or the entire time horizon), CM matches approximately the same number of pairs as the online scenario (matching each time a new incompatible pair joins the pool) does. Waiting, however, a linear fraction between every two runs will result in matching linearly more pairs compared to the online scenario. We then analyze CM when cycles of length both 2 and 3 are allowed. We show that for some regimes, sub-linear waiting will result in a linear addition of matches comparing to the online scenario. Finally, we study the efficiency of dynamic matching with chains (chains are initiated by a non-directed donor), and show that in the online scenario, adding one non-directed donor will increase linearly the number of matches that CM will find over the number of matches it will find without a chain.Our results may be of independent interest to the literature on dynamic matching in random graphs. Kidney exchange serves well as an example for which we have distributional information on the underlying graphs, thus we can exploit this information to make analysis and prediction far more accurate than the worst-case analysis can do. We believe our average-case analysis can have implications beyond the kidney exchange and can be applied to other dynamic allocation problems with such distributional information. Further, from a theoretical perspective, our paper initiates a novel direction in matching over time, deviating from the online scenarios.While this paper focuses on kidney exchange, there are many dynamic markets for barter exchange for which our findings apply. There is a growing number of websites that accommodate a marketplace for exchange of goods (often more than 2 goods), e.g. ReadItSwapIt.com and Swap.com. In these markets, the demand for goods, cycle lengths and waiting times play a significant role in efficiency.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Fourteenth ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce}, pages = {25–26}, numpages = {2}, keywords = {market design, matching}, location = {Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA}, series = {EC '13} }

Recently, chains---sequences of transplants initiated by an altruistic kidney donor---have shown marked success in practice, yet remain poorly understood. We provide a theoretical analysis of the efficacy of chains in the most widely used kidney exchange model, proving that long chains do not help beyond chains of length of 3 in the large. This completely contradicts our real-world results gathered from the budding nationwide kidney exchange in the United States; there, solution quality improves by increasing the chain length cap to 13 or beyond. We analyze reasons for this gulf between theory and practice, motivated by our experiences running the only nationwide kidney exchange. We augment the standard kidney exchange model to include a variety of real-world features. Experiments in the static setting support the theory and help determine how large is really "in the large". Experiments in the dynamic setting cannot be conducted in the large due to computational limitations, but with up to 460 candidates, a chain cap of 4 was best (in fact, better than 5).}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems - Volume 2}, pages = {711–718}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {kidney exchange}, location = {Valencia, Spain}, series = {AAMAS '12} }
